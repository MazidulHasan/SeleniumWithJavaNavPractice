Implicit wait:
Explicit wait:
    > Fluent wait 
    > Webdriver wait

Here webdriver wait comes from fluent wait. What ever we can do on fluent wait we can 
do the same thing in webdriver wait. 
So why they are different::
> Fluent wait is a concept. We do not need to give any polingEvey duration/withTimeout
etc. We can do it simply just defining it and use it.

> Fluent wait is like a tool so that other external tool can implement 
the functionality. It is like a template.
